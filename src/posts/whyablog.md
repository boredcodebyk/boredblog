# Well, why a blog?

TLDR, for no reason. I'm just bored. But, it's fun to try out new stuffs. So here I'm. I don't know how long I'll keep this up.

In this blog my goal is to share my random ideas or thoughts or any update regarding any project I do.

# Inspiration

I was randomly scrolling YouTube when I found out [NetworkChuck's Video: I started a blog.....in 2024 (why you should too)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8). That was the inspiration. Since I was learning SvelteKit, I thought why not give it a try, and here I'm. But yeah, I mostly followed this tutorial [https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-markdown-blog](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-markdown-blog) and got to learn how to make API inside SvelteKit.
There's many more things I want to do here, but for now I'll leave here.
